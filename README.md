Answer to question 6
Why can't browsers read JSX

Browsers cannot read JSX because there is no inherent implementation for the browser engines to read and understand it. You can use babel to transform your jsx into native javascript and HTML which browser can understand. Also, JSX is not valid JavaScript, browsers can't read it directly; they do not know what to do with it, so we need a transpiler to translate it to React.
